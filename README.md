# Webcrawler

This program is a simple web crawler that takes a webpage URL and an interger for the depth of the search to be performed and applies two different tree traversal methods to access more webpages through the hyperlinks found on the original page. The program constructs a graph with the read hyperlinks as nodes and traverses it using a breadth first search and a depth first search.
